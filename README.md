# Data Analysis of user reviews of Demon Slayer manga on Amazon
Hello, everyone. 

My main motivation for this project was to have a collected analysis of every volume of Demon Slayer if there was a time I would by the entire set. 

Using beautifulsoup, I scraped reviews for each volume on Amazon into a .json file. Then, I created a web app to display my results including the wordcloud and the most frequent words and relevant topics related to the review.
