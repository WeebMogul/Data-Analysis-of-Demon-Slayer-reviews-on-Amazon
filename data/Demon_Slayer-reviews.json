Idk but I'm already in love with the main character so I'm hooked whoops", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 1: Cruelty"}, {"title": "Generic and rushed.", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "I picked this up because I'd heard the anime based on this source material was taking the world by storm, and generally if an anime is based on a manga I opt to read it first before delving into the series. Perhaps I expected too much from this based on the hype, but I came out of it pretty disappointed. The story, while admittedly intriguing and dark, is also very generic, copy-paste-with-different-characters type of manga. To be certain, you have seen or read this before. That isn't always a deal breaker for me, as I actually like seeing how the familiar story we know and love might differ in another person's hands. However, in this case as it turns out, not all that well.  (Very minor spoilers ahead, but not much that isn't already on the back cover or in the item description.)  The story takes place in Taisho-era Japan (1912 - 1926) and our young protagonist, Tanjiro Kamado, is heading off down the cold and dangerous path from his mountain home into the town below to sell some coal so that he can help feed and clothe his family. He's greeted well by the townsfolk who seem to love him, and it's quickly revealed that Tanjiro seems to have an almost supernatural ability the rest of us do not (because of course he would), and the townspeople ask him to use it to aid in their squabbles, as well as requesting his assistance with other little things around the village. Before he knows it, it's getting very late, and the path home is even much more treacherous at night, as a kindly gentleman reveals to the reader that demons roam in the shadows of the woods. He insists Tanjiro stay the night with him, and return home in the morning, to which our little hero reluctantly agrees. The next morning he sets off back home, but to his horror, arrives there to find his family slaughtered. All perished with the exception of his little sister, who seems to have become a demon herself. Cue gag-worthy, cookie-cutter \"mysterious\" demon slaying stranger who's cold-hearted yet righteous (and much too young-looking to be so cynical), who decides he sees something special in our young Tanjiro and his fang-y little sister, and sends them to meet an even more mystifying sensei who will train Tanjiro to become the thing demons have nightmares about. Cue the Rocky theme song and really corny (and again oh-so generic) training montage that only takes up half a chapter, but is meant to span about two years time, in which Tanjiro doesn't seem to have aged at all other than some hair growth. There is also a suuuper, I'm talking extra large nacho cheese-y reveal at this point that actually made me snort and roll my eyes. Oh, and during all this training, Tanjiro’s sister has been (temporarily I’m sure) basically written out of the story for mere convenience sake, it would appear, due to some silly, lackluster excuse that happens off-page and barely explained to us in passing.  The whole thing feels entirely too rushed. It's as if the mangaka, Koyoharu Gotōge, is incredibly overeager to get to the juicy action, but doesn't want to bother with the \"boring\" parts of building up to that, like, you know, the actual story, which in turn makes you feel very little for the characters or what happens to them.  The art is another small issue that I personally had with it, as to be frank, it just doesn't measure up to a lot of other popular manga out there at the moment. Don't expect the polished look you get from a lot of your other favorites, with some really rough and jagged character line-work. Curiously, the backgrounds look better than the characters, albeit a bit lazy, and Koyoharu does put a lot of good (and I'm sure time-consuming) work and love into giving most characters their own fairly detailed clothing patterns.  At the end of the day, I didn't hate or even overly dislike this manga. The younger crowd who haven't been spoiled by better renditions of this familiar story are sure to love it. It was nothing new, or even very good, but it did allow me to sort of check out of reality and keep me turning the page somehow. I did find myself rushing through it, where I'll normally to take my time reading manga to appreciate the art, but it was an okay way to pass some time. That being said, it in no way has me in a hurry to read the next one. I will, as I'd like to be fair and give it one more chance and tie up the loose end the cliffhanger left me with, but if it doesn't improve in the second volume I may just switch to watching the anime, which looks to be more polished and improved upon, or abandon it entirely.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 1: Cruelty"}, {"title": "Excellent Shounen!", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "The art uses some shaky lines that can be hard to get used to it one is accustomed to more smooth, finished styles, but this art sets off the story being told really well.

The hype that I heard was right, this was so good! Within 20 pages the action already had me hooked and on the edge of my seat.  It's hard for me to find fault in manga, because, unless it's something I just straight-up don't agree with or can't get past, I will enjoy it no matter.  With that said, I'll tell you it is a typical Shonen manga where a weaker young man strives to get stronger to save/protect someone he loves, these kind of tropes are not turn off for me but I know to some they are, so I felt like it should be mentioned. However I believe once the story gets deeper in it will be a lot more than just a classic trope to hook people.  The art was great, it gave off a nostalgic vibe of mangas past, and I found that comforting in a way that made the darker parts of the story not so heavy, yet it also gave the comedic effects more of a realistic tone. When I started reading it, I did not realize that it was set in the Taisho era of Japan, so I kept thinking to myself why are the characters in these periodic costumes, but after learning that the story is set in a certain era and not just a fantasy world it made me appreciate the art a little more, especially the eye for detail to make the setting and characters appropriate for the time.  the characters are interesting and the plot is well rounded, I believe the story can only get better from here on out, and I plan to continue reading.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 1: Cruelty"}, {"title": "Great Starting Manga Series", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "It was a solid introduction into understanding Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko.

But Tanjiro works hard and does what he can to help provide for his mother and many siblings after the death of his father. Hoping to provide for a happy New Year for his loved ones, the weary Tanjiro wants to go into town, despite the weather, to sell more charcoal. But he is prevented from getting back and ends up spending the night there, heading home at first light. Upon his return, he is met with the horrific sight of his family, dead and bloody from some sort of massacre. The stricken Tanjiro realizes his sister Nezuko is still breathing, and hurries to get her to town, where she can be helped. When he slips and accidentally drops her, he realizes that Nezuko has become a demon, turned by the same creature that killed his family!  Just after this realization hits him, as he attempts to keep his demon sister from biting him, a stranger unexpectedly swoops in and attempts to kill her. He is confused as to why Tanjiro, a human, should be protecting a demon. But Tanjiro tells him that she’s his sister and he will do everything he can to help her become human again. He tells the stranger that Nezuko hasn’t killed anyone and won’t harm anyone. He finally persuades the man, whose name is Giyu, and Giyu tells him to go to see an old man named Sakonji Urokodaki at the foot of Mount Sagiri, and to tell him Giyu Tomioka sent him.  In order to travel that far, Tanjiro realizes he can’t avoid sunlight, much as Nezuko would like to, so he acquires an old basket and fixes it up for her so he can carry her on his back. On the journey, they are attacked by a demon, but luckily they are met by Urokodaki, in a tengu mask, who was apprised of their arrival by Giyu. Giyu told him Tanjiro seems promising, and has the same strong sense of smell that Urokodaki does. The older man makes Tanjiro figure out how to kill the demon himself then leads both him and Nezuko back to his mountain, never cutting the boy any slack. He leaves Tanjiro at the top of the mountain and says he’ll train him if he can make it down by morning. Tanjiro thinks that’s easy, with his sense of smell, but of course it isn’t.  Tanjiro has taken his first step toward becoming a Demon Slayer and recovering his sister’s lost humanity.  I have been watching the anime, and just started reading the manga. I really like it, and I think they complement one another well. It’s a sad story about bravery in the face of tragedy, of a brother’s love for his sister and his determination to give her back the life she had before, as well as a supernatural story about demons and humans. Tanjiro is a sweet boy, and very kind. Sometimes too kind, to the point of being indecisive, which his mentor fears in his nature. But he also has a steely quality that I think will stand him in good stead in the future.  Urokodaki’s tengu mask is intriguing, and I’m sure there’s a story as to why he always wears it, one we will find out later. A side note, the actor who voices Urokodaki in the anime is the same one who voices Jiraiya in Naruto (win-win for me because I love Jiraiya lol) The story of how Tanjiro splits the boulder is sadly sweet. Tanjiro’s trial as part of the final selection to become a demon slayer is filled with intrigue and potential death for all involved. Not all the candidates will come out alive.  I like the artwork very much, and I look forward to reading more volumes.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 1: Cruelty"}, {"title": "I liked this beginning and it's kind of retro feel", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 1' by Koyoharu Gotouge is a manga about a young boy learning to fight demons.

A história se inicia e 'termina' neste mesmo volume. Explico-me. O protagonista nem sabe o que é um Demon Slayer e, ao final das páginas, já está prestes a passar na seleção que o oficializará como Demon Slayer. Isso tudo acontece em menos de 200 páginas.

Even though he has to kill the demon, Tanjiro shows compassion to him at the end, and helps to ease him into death. Only four of the original twenty candidates remain, and now they learn about what will happen. They each have the rank of mizunoto, which is the lowest. Each will receive a katana and a crow. They will choose the ore for the katana, but it may take a couple of weeks for it to be finished.  Tanjiro heads for Urokodaki’s home, to find Nezuko awake and happy to see him. His sensei is also overjoyed and embraces both children. He later tells Tanjiro that he believes Nezuko sleeps the way she does in order to recharge her energy without consuming human blood. Fifteen days later, Tanjiro’s katana is delivered by a man called Haganezuka. He refers to it as a Nichirin sword, a color-changing sword. Excited at the sight of Tanjiro, he refers to him as a child of brightness, and hopes that his sword might turn red. But it turns black instead, which they say is a color rarely seen.  Tanjiro learns that his crow actually talks when he receives his first assignment as a Demon Slayer. He is to go to a northern town where young girls disappear night after night! Urokodaki makes a very light box for Tanjiro to carry Nezuko in during the day, made of kirikumo cedar. On arrival in the town, he finds a very distraught young man, whose fiancé is missing. Suddenly, Tanjiro smells a demon, and he springs into action! Urokodaki had told Tanjiro that only one demon has the power to turn humans into demons, and that is Muzan Kibutsuji. So Tanjiro is determined to question every demon he comes across for information regarding Muzan.  Tanjiro has the demon trapped in an alleyway, but the demon is able to split himself into three. Nezuko helps him, but then he tells her to keep safe the young man and the young girl he just saved while he faces the demons. Immediately after this job, he is sent on a second mission, to Asakusa in Tokyo, where a demon is rumored to be hiding. He and Nezuko stop by a udon vendor’s cart. Suddenly, Tanjiro smells the same scent he detected at the scene of his family’s murder. Can he have found his prey already?  Tanjiro has come a long way in a short time. But despite the tragedy that has befallen, he maintains his loving nature, especially toward his sister, whom he would do anything to bring her back to the way she was. The battle with the first demon was great, and I won’t say anything about the trip to Tokyo. I’ll save all of that for the next review, to avoid spoilers lol You just know Tanjiro’s journey to seek normalcy for his sister won’t be an easy one, and it’s hard not to root for him. I certainly do.  Looking forward to the third volume.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 2: It Was You"}, {"title": "Entertaining and fast-paced", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "The first volume of this manga had left us on a cliffhanger moment - Tanjiro just about to attack a poewrful demon as part of his final test to get into the Demon Hunting Corps. As expected, he makes it, but a lot of the kids don't. Still reeling from this test, he gets back to his master to find Nezuho awakened, and soon after he gets his first mission and then his second. Now armed with information about the demon who killed his family and turned his sister, he is seeking vengeance and a way to turn her back.  As usual, this manga packs a lot of action and development in a single volume, so if I keep discussing every thing this review is going to be hella long. To keep it short, The fight scenes are amazing, as always, and the sword positions are rendered in a majestic style. What I loved even more in this volume is Asakusa during the Taisho era, drawn in detail, and how Tanjiro reacts to the 'big city'. He also meets his nemesis and two surprising allies, which actually changes a lot about what we know about demons from volume 1! The doctor Tamayo gave me Carlisle Cullen feels, truly - and Yushiro is a stock tsundere character, but I'm interested to see how this new alliance turns out. (Would his fellow demon hunters approve? Knowing Tanjiro, I doubt he will care much, but still...)  During all the action, there are still spots of levity. Tanjiro's innocent personality, even when being handed a special sword, his anger when Yushiro calls Nezuho brutish, because how could anyone not see how beautiful his sister is?! Also, Nezuho's high kicks give me life because girl saves him from those tight spots! I honestly love this sibling duo, and everyone's reactions to finding a demon and a demon hunter together.

There they are attacked by two of Kibutsuji’s demons, Susamaru and Yahaba. Tanjiro has met his match with Yahaba, the arrow demon. The disdainful demon cuts Tanjiro’s opening thread, and refers to him as a dirty child. The two demons decide to take back both Tanjiro’s head and Tamayo’s, as she is a runaway, hoping to please their master. Tanjiro finds himself helpless against the manipulation of Yahaba’s arrows, but he has to succeed, he can’t afford to lose. In the meantime, Nezuko is fending off the temari balls that Susumaru is throwing at her. Tamayo finds Nezuko’s growing strength—without consuming human flesh—to be amazing.  Afterward, as they prepare to leave, Tamayo offers to keep Nezuko with them and out of harm’s way. But Tanjiro can’t bring himself to leave his sister behind, especially after seeing the look in her eyes. Together forever, that’s what they are.  Tanjiro receives another mission immediately, and on the way there, he runs across an odd fellow in the middle of the road who is begging a woman to marry him. The woman looks horrified. Tanjiro helps her out, only to discover that the whiny guy is a fellow Demon Slayer named Zenitsu. Zenitsu is a pitiful excuse for a Demon Slayer, and loudly proclaims just how weak he really is. They travel on together and encounter two trembling children outside of a house. Turns out that it’s a house of monsters and their brother is inside! Zenitsu complains of the noise coming from the house, but Tanjiro can’t hear anything.  Tanjiro leaves the box with Nezuko with the children for their protection, and takes Zenitsu into the house. But the children follow unexpectedly. Tanjiro and the girl, whose name is Teruko, become separated from Zenitsu and the boy. Tanjiro begins to realize that the rooms change. He sees a large demon, whose smell is the strongest in the house. Meanwhile another player has entered the scene, a bare-chested fellow with a boar’s head over his head, and he’s wielding nichirin swords.  One of Demon Slayer’s strengths is its great characters. It’s hard not to like and root for Tanjiro and Nezuko, even if she is a demon. Not like it’s her fault or anything. And she goes against the grain in that she doesn’t want to hurt humans and wants to protect them instead. Ditto with Lady Tamayo, even if Yushiro is a bit of an ass. Muzan Kibutsuji, although not seen in this volume, is a fascinating and rather charming demon – my weakness! Now we have Zenitsu, who I find utterly whiny and spineless, but my kid assures me he has redeeming qualities, which I shall discover. I have to admit the very last scene caused me to tear up, and that involved him. The jury is still out on Mr. Boar’s Head (at this point I don’t know his name but I figured out he’s my kid’s favorite character, so I imagine I will find reason to like him too, in time).  I liked the introduction of Tamayo’s cat, who definitely serves a purpose. The demons in the house were very imaginative, especially with the moving rooms in the house, and I enjoyed that part, although I grieved at the death of one of the demon, who was actually very creative and not wholly evil. I’m also watching the anime at the same time, and I think I am only slightly ahead of the volumes I am reading. I would recommend that too. You can find it on Crunchyroll, and I believe on Netflix too. Looking forward to the next book!", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 3: Believe in Yourself"}, {"title": "Okay", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "~3 Stars At this point, I really don't get the huge fanbase for this series. Maybe the anime is different? Maybe it gets better? Given the previous rush of plot points, it was no surprise that this cliffhanger battle wraps up rather quickly. And of course it doesn't quite go where he hoped it would, so Tanjiro is off on another mission from the crow. This new mission features some kids trapped inside a demon-controlled, ever-changing house. It's a bit of a puzzle, which is complicated by Tanjiro meeting another demon slayer, only this one is utterly useless and whines and cries and is too terrified by demons to fight them. Zenitsu is more annoying than funny. But my actual issue with this volume, was the fact that supposedly Tanjiro was majorly injured—he claimed to have a broken rib and leg—and yet, he was still doing a lot of fighting and jumping around. He was doing way too much moving around to have that many injuries, and it just seemed unnecessary. Zenitsu wasn't forced to take enough of the fighting for it to be necessary, I didn't think. The only real interest I have in this series is Nezuko, honestly. I find her character really interesting, and I want to like the brother-sister relationship focus. I'm just not all that into the other characters, or the way the story is being told, I think.  (A review copy was provided by the publisher, VIZ Media, for an honest review.

Tanjiro, Nezuho and the other two demons have a rough fight with two of Kibutsuji’s henchmen. During and after the battle, we get to know a lot about him, his powers, and the threat he presents, to both humans and demons alike. And moving onto the next mission, Tanjiro comes across one of his fellow inductees, a coward and extremely whiny character in the form of Zenitsu, who seems like he got forced into this business and has a lot of anxiety about it. Both of them then proceed to enter a house where demons have trapped humans, and this was another instance where we get to know a lot about demons and their blood magic. Additionally, it reinforces Tanjiro’s kindness, who is sad to have to kill demons for the sake of protecting humans. And unknown to him, we also see the demon’s backstory (all of them were created from humans after all) and how he got roped into being Kibutsuji’s minion.

We get to know a bit more about the organization of the Demon Slayer Corps, as the trio is then invited to stay at a house of a family that serves them. However, the next mission they are sent for is extremely lethal, as the adventure takes to a mountain full of spider demons, who can make puppets out of living bodies and infect them to create more spider demons (It's all very gross) and it seems like even the Demon Slayer Corps is aware of how dangerous it is, as they are planning to send their elite team (which I hope gets there fast!!!)  Inosuke's addition is a bit hilarious and also a bit irritating. Firstly, he and Tanjiro seem meant to be friends, as they are both block-headed and naive. I mean, look at this panel: Tanjiro asking him for how he writes his name after he introduces himself, and this is happening in the middle of the duel these two are having. *facepalm*  On the other hand, though, he is almost as irritating as Zenistu, and it is only Tanjiro's saintly patience (which is a lot of good-natured optimism and sheer naiveness) that is holding this squad together. We had only one Nezuko sighting this volume, which I honestly don't blame her for - I too would stick to the box if these two were company. (Also how adorable is Zenitsu's crush on her?! It gave him courage)  Finally, this manga was a good mix of characterization and action, as well as world-building.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 4: Robust Blade"}, {"title": "A treacherous web is being spun, who will be ensnared?", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "Zenitsu awakens to find himself outside of the house of monsters, with no memory of what happened or how he got there. He’s too grateful to question that, though. Until the guy with the boar’s head comes charging out, exclaims he smells demon, and heads straight for Tanjiro’s box! What else can Zenitsu do but defend it, because this is more precious than life to Tanjiro, no matter the cost? Tanjiro himself arrives just in time to defend the battered Zenitsu from being beaten any further. Turns out the guy with the boar’s head is Inosuke, and he’s a Demon Slayer too.  Tanjiro’s crow arrives and leads the three Demon Slayers to the house of the Fuji Family, who have a wisteria crest, where they can heal. In the middle of the night, Zenitsu is upset to find that Tanjiro’s box seems to be moving. When Nezuko comes out, Zenitsu becomes angry because Tanjiro’s been keeping this cute girl all to himself!  Once healed, the three receive an urgent summons. They must head to Mount Natagumo as soon as possible. En route, they run across another member of the Demon Slayer Corps, who seems to be badly injured, and begs for their help. Suddenly, the young man is picked up and pulled back into the forest. Tanjiro and Inosuke decide to go in after him, while Zenitsu waits for them. They meet another member of the Corps who is disappointed to see them since they are such low level Slayers. He explains that he is part of a group of ten Hashira level slayers who, once they arrived at this place, began to kill one another! They have all fallen under the spell of a powerful Demon!  It seems that some of the Slayers have become hideous hybrid spider creatures! And the demons who are doing this to them are part of some evil Family. How will Tanjiro and Inosuke combat them if they get caught up in their spider strands?  This volume of Demon Slayer finds the boys getting into trouble while on the way to Mount Natagumo. This family of demons is very creepy, and a great challenge to both Tanjiro and Inosuke. It will be interesting to see how they fight their way out. I love how Zenitsu has become totally devoted to Nezuko (even though he knows she is a demon). We get a little of his back story in this volume, and I have to admit I like him better than I did before, especially when he’s sleeping lol. The jury is still out on Inosuke, although I might change my mind about him later, but as of right now, he’s given me no reason to and I find him very annoying. Not much of Nezuko this time, but hopefully more in the next volume.

Each of their respective techniques seem to be no match for the father demon, and when Tanjiro is punted far away from the battle, he encounters the true leader of the demon family, and learns a bit more himself and his skills. While the chapters are mostly filled with intense beautifully stylized sword-fighting scenes, and chaotic battles, it also brings up yet another demon’s past, and how they came to be, as well as Nezuko finally tapping into her own blood magic. Alongwith this, it brings back an old character as well as a new character – both of whom are elite warriors of the Demon Slaying Corps.  Family was a prominent theme of the story, with the leading demon doing this to ‘protect’ his family, and seeing his family bonds to be a pale imitation of the bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko. That motif – of a demon and a demon slayer being siblings – is one that is being brought up time and again, and with Nezuko’s powers finally manifesting in this volume, it feels like it signals a different path that these two are about to take, a partnership that will be always confusing to either side. Also, the love they have for one another is what keeps the other fighting, and that is their strength; coupled with Tanjiro’s sensitivity and Nezuko’s protectiveness, this pair of siblings are obviously going to herald a change into how demons are fought.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 5: To Hell"}, {"title": "A family held together through fear", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "While on their way to Mt. Natagumo, having been summoned there, Tanjiro, Inosuke, and Zenitsu find themselves battling a family of spider demons in the forest! Although not actually related, Rui binds the family together through fear because of his desire to be part of a family. The largest spider demon is the father, who acts on orders from his “children”.  As Inosuke faces down the father, Tanjiro tells him to hang in there, he’ll be back as soon as he can. But Inosuke has doubts he will last that along. However assistance arrives from an unexpected source, and Inosuke is impressed by the skill of the newcomer. Tanjiro has problems of his own, though, when his blade breaks.  Rui captures Nezuko and tells Tanjiro he will let him live if he gives up his sister to him. Of course, Tanjiro won’t agree to that. The daughter spider demon sees the relationship between Tanjiro and Nezuko and longs for something like that for herself. Will Tanjiro be able to rescue his sister when the web these demons weave is so very strong?  Another member of the Hashira arrives, Shinobu, who is adorned with butterflies. Admittedly the only Hashira who cannot cut off a demon’s head, she has her own methods of defeating them. Namely through the use of poisons. Shinobu is determined to rid the world of all demons. And she makes no exception for the demon that Tanjiro is protecting. Will she kill Nezuko?  Most of this volume is about the demon spiders and the fight against them, but we do gain two new characters – Shinobu and Tomioka. I liked seeing the backstory of the demons, and how they came to form a “family”. That just goes to reinforce what Tanjiro says about demons all having been human at one time. We also see how Muzan insinuates himself into a situation in order to make new demons.  On an aside, I love the colors of Tanjiro’s outfit, as well as his earrings. I read that patterns from Demon Slayer have now been trademarked.

Tomioka tells Tanjiro to take Nezuko and flee, but Shinobu is determined to slay the demon in their midst. Luckily a message arrives to take both Tanjiro and his sister to headquarters. There Tanjiro is told he is to be put on trial.  The Hashira have differing opinions on what to do with Tanjiro and his sister, and some of their solutions are rather bloodthirsty. One of them is more concerned with punishing Tomioka since he broke the rules by protecting a demon. Tanjiro tries to explain about the circumstances which led to Nezuko becoming a demon, and how she has never eaten human flesh in all this time and would never hurt a human. And how he became a swordsman in order to protect her. One rather insane Hashira, covered with scars, picks up Nezuko’s box and decides to insert his sword into it randomly. Naturally, Tanjiro attacks him, even though his hands are bound behind him and he has no weapon.  The Master of the mansion arrives, and he seems like a rather laid back sort of guy. He tells the others that he accepts Tanjiro and Nezuko, then proceeds to have read a letter from Urokodaki, verifying what Tanjiro has been trying to tell them. The Master then explains that Muzan Kibutsuji has sent agents after the brother and sister, thus exposing more of himself to them than he has ever done before. Surely this means something. The insane Hashira decides to test Nezuko for himself, though, expecting to trick her into drinking human blood.  While the Hashira deliberate, Tanjiro is sent to the Butterfly Mansion. They take him and Nezuko to the infirmary, where he is reunited with an unhappy Zenitsu and a slumbering Inosuke. The four are left to heal until Shinobu comes to tell them it’s time for their rehabilitation training. After a few days of intense training, Zenitsu and Inosuke quit showing up, but Tanjiro persists. He is determined to do his best and then help the others to succeed as well.  Since Tanjiro’s sword was broken, a new one needs to be forged. And the sword maker is not happy that this is necessary, taking it out on Tanjiro when he delivers the new blade. And in other news, another side of Muzan Kibutsuji is revealed.  I love the humor in these stories, and I love the characters. They are very much unique and well-drawn. There is also a great deal of warmth and love, especially between Tanjiro and his sister, and the way he relates to other people. Well, most of the time. He does have his moments, of course. The surprise reveal about Muzan was … well, surprising. I certainly didn’t see that coming.  Still haven’t changed my mind about Inosuke, maybe later.

Tanjiro says “he’s suffered enough”. The demon blames Tanjiro for what happened, but most of all he blames Rengoku. Although Tanjiro is injured, he is encouraged by Rengoku to keep doing his best, which words he takes to heart.  But it’s not all over, not when a higher rank demon suddenly appears! Impressed by his strength, he tries to get Rengoku to become a demon. If not, he plans to kill him. Rengoku warns Tanjiro to stay still, so he can heal, and not to get involved in this fight. As morning approaches, and with it the light, the demon fights even harder, and although Inosuke and Tanjiro join in the battle, the results are not as they would wish.  Rengoku tells Tanjiro that he believes in Nezuko, having seen that she is good, and not to grieve over him. But of course Tanjiro grieves, as so the other Hashira. Meanwhile the demon reports to Lord Muzan, who is currently using the appearance of a child. Muzan isn’t impressed with the death of one demon slayer – he seeks the death of the entire corps.  Entrusted by Rengoku with messages for his father and brother, Tanjiro slips away, although not fully healed, in order to comply with Rengoku’s wishes. While his brother is sad, Rengoku’s father is angry and denounces his son as worthless. He takes out his frustrations on Tanjiro. And if that wasn’t bad enough, Tanjiro has to face Haganezuka again!  Tanjiro stops Ranao from being kidnapped in order to go on a mission, but finds himself volunteering in her place, and he is joined by Inosuke and Zenitsu. Oh-oh, what’s up now?  This volume was unexpected due to the loss of some we barely got to know. Much sadness, but that, of course, is a part of life., which is one of this manga’s strengths. The good don’t always win and the bad don’t always lose. Tanjiro is growing as a character, but to are Inosuke and Zenitsu. I am curious to see what mission the three will undertake next, and who is this guy with the unusual bejeweled look?

Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inoskue agree to go with him on a mission in order to spare the shy Kanao. They have no idea what they are getting themselves into! Tengen begins by explaining to the three demon slayers that he is a god and they are trash. What a way to begin a working relationship! He takes them into the Entertainment District. While he searches for a Demon, their job is to find and contact his three wives, who are working undercover there. Unsure exactly which houses they are at, Tengen has narrowed the list down to the three most likely locations and splits up the three demon slayers accordingly. However, there is a catch… they also have to dress as women and they have to be selected by these houses!  After making them up as women, Tengen approaches the first house. The owners find the “girls” ugly but decide to take the honest-looking one, Tanjiro. A Madam from the House Ogimoto offers to take Inosuke, which only leaves Zenitsu, who is angry at Tengen because he is too handsome (he has removed his flashiness momentarily). When they clean up Inosuke, they find his natural looks much more pleasing than the make-up job Tengen did on him, not surprising since he has a girly face. Tengen manages to place Zenitsu, even though he is considered to be ugly, because of Tengen’s own good looks. But it’s the House’s lucky day as “she” proves to be very talented, despite “her” looks.  The three begin to investigate, listening and watching, and they learn that girls have been going missing, to the consternation of the other girls. Tanjiro learns that one of the missing girls is one of Tengen’s wives! Can they find the missing girls and rescue them before it’s too late?  I must say Tengen is an interesting character, although very arrogant and full of himself. I was sad when Rengoku died unexpectedly in the last arc. And even though Tengen is the way he is, I would hate to see him suffer the same fate. He certainly is flashy, though, and he knows how to fight. Seeing Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke in drag is hilarious! I wasn’t surprised that they washed off Inosuke’s make-up and found what was beneath to be much better. As usual, there is a great deal of humor in this volume as well as drama, as they search for Tengen’s missing wives. (I assume polygamy is okay here). An intriguing behind-the-scenes look at a few of the houses in the Entertainment District. I love the artwork, especially the full color pictures.

Uzui had sent in his three wives (yep, three!) undercover and when they didn’t check in, he is worried and so sends these three baby demon slayers as new girls to become courtesans and find out what the heck is going on. Firstly I can’t believe anyone would think Tanjiro is plain-looking, even in bad makeup – like how dare anyone even suggest that about this cute boy! Zenitsu is brash as always, and hilarious to prove he can be a good courtesan (not the mission, dude). Inosuke is reluctantly tempering his wild side to appear at least close to ladylike while he investigates and tries to find Uzui’s missing wife. The demon in question was hiding in plain sight, obviously, but they do have one heck of a tough battle with it. Tanjiro is also thinking about the breathing techniques he uses and how he can choose the best one to deal with this particularly talented demon. It ends on sort of a cliffhanger, but not so much to worry you about the next installment. Overall, an entertaining arc once again.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 9: Operation: Entertainment..."}, {"title": "Red Light District Arc begins!", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "This volume covers the red light district arc with Uzui (the sound pillar) and Inosuke, Tanjiro, and Zenitsu masquerading as girls (which they all do poorly). Personally loved this volume since Gotouge gets the chance to draw an entire volume of women and also that a new female Demon makes an appearance! It ends in a fight above and underground with all the players finally appearing.  This arc is actually one of the most funny arcs in the series, along with being a mystery/detective volume as we the readers are also eager to find out who was preventing Uzui's wives from contacting him and the latter half is full of action after we find the culprit. ☆☆☆☆", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 9: Operation: Entertainment..."}, {"title": "I love this series", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "And now I have to wait for the next one again!!!

The demon is pleased at the presence of a Hashira, knowing that Muzan Kibutsuji will be pleased. Tanjiro is determined to take her down, unable and unwilling to tolerate the presence of soulless monsters in this world. He is attempting to slice off her head, but the many strands of her obi are preventing him from doing so. Just when things look pretty bleak, it’s Nezuko to the rescue! Daki realizes she is the demon Lord Muzan told her of, and is determined to end Nezuko’s life for her lord’s sake.  Nezuko’s strength seems to have grown, as she fights against Daki. But she seems to be losing control of herself in the process, and Tanjiro fears for her. Tengen’s arrival is fortuitous. Hopefully Tanjiro can persuade his sister to go to sleep and heal. Tengen succeeds in slicing off Daki’s head… but it’s not going to be that simple. A second demon has arisen from Daki’s back. Turns out she has a brother, Gyutaro, and he’s worse than his sister. Oh dear! And just as determined to protect Daki as Tanjiro is to protect Nezuko.  And now the arrival of the cavalry in the form of Inosuke and Zenitsu, and thank goodness Zenitsu is asleep!  I love to watch Tanjiro develop as a fighter, the way he learns from his mistakes, as well as his determination to succeed. Not for himself, but for his loved ones as well as all people. He is such a good character, and so is Nezuko. In this volume, we meet another brother and sister who are just as devoted to one another. A good study in the definitions of love and good versus evil. It’s not all black and white, and no one is entirely bad, not even demons. I enjoyed seeing a little bit of Inosuke’s backstory in a bonus chapter. My kid loves him, and I still haven’t spotted his redeeming values, more how irritating he is, but I haven’t given up on him. He’ll probably grow on me lol Still prefer Zenitsu asleep.

Still, most determined demon goes to Nezuko who kinda gives it her all, so much that she pretty much goes feral, and even Tanjiro has to step in to restrain her.

While Uzui and Tanjiro try to battle the brother, Inosuke and Zenitsu are trying to subdue the sister. In both cases, they are outmatched, since these demons are of the upper rank, and with the specific abilities of their bodies, it is quite difficult to behead either of them, let alone both of them. The battle pushes them beyond their limits, with Tanjiro experimenting with combining different styles and understanding specific styles that the hashira have, and Zenitsu bringing out a powerful but can-only-activate-once move. They come close to winning and defeat, both, several times, and it is practically a fight to see who outlasts the other before they collapse. Uzui himself had entertained the idea of retiring after killing one of the Kizuki demons, so this fight becomes extra special to him, both in terms of a final mission and a hope for a quieter future. Honestly it is non-stop beautifully drawn action from start to finish, so it will keep you on your toes.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 11: A Close Fight"}, {"title": "Of brothers and sisters...", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "Daki’s brother Gyutaro is fast, like a mantis. He’s proving to be difficult to kill, even with the combined efforts of Tengen, Tanjiro and the others. Thinking quickly, Tanjiro slices off his feet and keeps them from regenerating with the use of wisteria extract. But how long can such tactics work on this demon?  Tanjiro’s quick thinking and fast actions save the life of one of Tengen’s wives. The Hashira is grateful to him, and says he owes him one. Everyone tries to cut off Gyutaro’s head, but that proves to be trickier than they thought. And now Daki is back in action? Perhaps they should cut off her head first… assuming they can.  Tanjiro refuses to give up, no matter how bleak things look. And they are looking pretty bleak. How many more will they have to lose?  In this volume, we get to see Daki and Gyutaro’s back story. No one is born evil, and neither were they. Sometimes people are born into difficult situations and they do the best they can. Also, we get a glimpse into the relationship between Tengen and his three wives. This was a pretty good battle, and it was hard to know what the outcome was going to be. But since this isn’t the last volume of the series, it should be apparent that good must prevail.

Apparently, they do not all get along, and even among so-called allies there is a certain amount of animosity and competitiveness as they attempt to curry Muzan’s faavor. Some of these demons are certainly less human than others and some are decidedly creepy. When Muzan announces the death of Gyutaro, Doma offers to gouge out one of his eyes as atonement for having brought Gyutaro and Daki to his lord’s notice. Muzan declines the offer. He tells them he sees them all as failures, having failed to live up to his expectations. The Ubuyashiki family is still alive and the blue spider lily has not been found. Gyokku claims to have information on the family’s whereabouts, so Muzan says once confirmation is obtained, he and Hantengu should go there.  Tanjiro awakens from what must have been a dream – or was it a memory – to find that he has been unconscious for two months. He asks after his friends and learns that Zenitsu awoke and was sent on a mission, and Tengen was up, but supported by his wives’ shoulders. Inosuke, on the other hand, was in bad shape. Tanjiro decides he must be hallucinating seeing Inosuke on the ceiling, but it’s really him. Tanjiro inquires if a katana has come for him, as his was chipped in the recent battle. But all he has received is an angry letter from Haganezuka. It is suggested that Tanjiro go to see the swordsmith in person , and Tanjiro is surprised to learn how close the swordsmith village is. But getting there is far from straightforward.  On Tanjiro’s arrival, he learns that the swordsmith has disappeared and is being sought. Probably sulking, they assume, as that is often his way. Not because his sword has been damaged but because of what he perceives as his shoddy workmanship that allowed the sword to be damaged. While searching, Tanjiro encounters a rude Hashira bullying a small swordsmith, so he intervenes. Tokito, the Mist Hashira, insists on using the practice doll, although Kotetsu tells him it will break. But every action has its consequences, even selfish ones.  This begins the Swordsmith Village arc, and we are seeing the upper ranked demons in larger numbers than before. Their relationship to their lord is interesting to watch, and you know they are just jockeying for position in order to get closer to him. They’re feeling the pressure of his displeasure and will do anything to regain his favor. The swordsmiths are interesting. We see little of Inosuke this volume, and none of Zenitsu, but I’m sure they’ll be back soon. Muzan is an interesting study, cold-hearted demon that he is. In this volume, he was actually standing on the ceiling as he addressed them. It’s always fun to watch Tanjiro battle, and he certainly has to keep his wits about him to defeat these foes. Hopefully he’ll be able to obtain the blood he needs to help cure Nezuko.  Great volume, looking forward to the next one!", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 12: The Upper Ranks Gather"}, {"title": "they just can't catch a break", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "With a hard-won battle, it is time for the demon slayers to take some rest, and this volume has them going to the secret swordsmith village to get a new blade for Tanjiro. Meanwhile, back in the demon camp, the upper demons are getting reamed out by Kibutsuji, who is disappointed they still haven’t discerned the location of Ubuyashiki, the head of the demon corps. There is a bit more exposition in this volume as the action has slowed down, with us learning more about the demon corps and their tactics for keeping their location secret, as well as the hierarchy within the organization. And finally, a bit of Tanjiro’s past itself is revealed, or rather, his ancestor’s past (though I must say, that is a broad extrapolation of epigenetic concepts)  Probably the most exciting part of this book is the introduction of the swordsmith’s village and a certain automaton in it. The Mist hashira has been bullying a swordsmith who has been tasked with guardianship of an automaton that has the fighting style of a long-ago master swordsman (who may or may not be connected to Tanjiro’s ancestors) and when Tanjiro intervenes, the swordsmith decides to let him improve his skills with the automaton, though he is very rough in his training of Tanjiro. Tanjiro adds another new skill in his repertoire, though – the ability to sense attacks through smell.

At first he sees no reason to do so, until he remembers what Tanjiro told him, that helping others can often help you help yourself. So he decides to assist Kotetsu.

With Nezuko’s blood strengthening his blade, Tanjiro calls upon the memory of another swordsman, one who came close to cutting off the demon Muzan’s head! But wait! There seems to be a fifth demon? Why can’t Genya see him? Genya tries but fails to cut off the little demon’s head. Will he allow Tanjiro to do what a Hashira cannot?

We had already seen how difficult it was to defeat just one upper rank demon in the previous arc, so it is obvious this one is going to be a long drawn-out battle. The book is fully action, and brings some new abilities to the fore. One of the demons can basically Hydra itself – splitting up every time it is beheaded which brings up an interesting conundrum since demons can only be defeated by beheading, while the other one is like a cursed genie, pulling all sorts of things from its pot, including a grotesque sculpture it makes of defeated swordsmen.  Nezuko and Tanjiro are once again the dream team, with Nezuko’s strong body paired with Tanjiro’s skills giving them enough time to take a stand. And when she uses her flames on his sword, it evokes a memory of Tanjiro’s ancestor in the demon – an ancestor who happens to be the only one who came close to defeating Kibutsuji, which makes this damn near prophetic right now! The Mist hashira is taking some cues from Tanjiro’s advice for kindness, as he stops to help a pillar fighting a demon instead on rushing into the main battle. Meanwhile, what is going on with Genya?

Lots of fights and story progression. Only problem i have is why Sanemi is on the cover when he isn't even in a single chapter of this volume?", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 17: Successors"}, {"title": "Great Volume And Worth Continuing Reading!", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "Volume 17 contains chapters 143 through 151. Following the previous volume, the Demon Slayer Corps dive straight into the labyrinth that is the Infinity Castle to confront their sworn enemy, Muzan. Shinobu engaged in a vicious battle against Doma, the Upper Rank 2 demon. She lacks the strength to cut off his head and poison him; her specialty doesn’t work on him. Now she finds herself in an intense struggle for her life and to avenger her older sister by defeating the demon that killed her. Meanwhile, another demon connected to Zenitsu’s past appears before him to block his path.  The title of this volume is Successors, which I found to be very fitting since the theme of succession is touched on several times throughout Volume 17 and the series. In Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, the concept of succession plays an essential role for many characters in the Demon Slayer Corps. A great example of this in Volume 17 is when Kiriya Ubuyashiki immediately becoming the 98th leader of the Demon Slayer Corps after his father’s passing.  The path to achieving the Demon Slayer Corps goal of putting an end to evil demonkind and defeating Muzan has been a long and tumultuous one. It has taken hundreds of years, generations of leaders, and many sacrifices. While those sacrifices came with many deaths and bloodshed, they were not done so in vain. They are done with the intention that the next generation is succeeding and taking on the duty of their predecessors so that they can carry the torch onward.  The action and intensity do not slow down in this volume. If anything, it takes it up another notch from where Volume 16 left off. This is to be expected since this volume is part of the Final Battle Arc in the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba series. The stakes are high for the characters as they engage in some of the most deadly combat they’ve ever faced.  The action and intensity are apparent in the art in all of the battle scenes. The mangaka, Koyoharu Gotouge, has a fantastic talent for illustrating impactful battle scenes. I especially love how they capture the characters’ fluid motions and the intensity of their facial expressions.  I especially loved the brief message the mangaka puts at the beginning of the volume. The mangaka’s message acknowledges and apologizes that reading might be grueling for some fans as it can be challenging to see favorite characters get hurt or defeated. I thought the message was a nice touch because it shows they understand the emotional connection that fans have to some of their favorite characters while also giving the heads up to readers that there is a rough road ahead for some fan-favorite characters.  This volume surprised me because it made me say something that I never thought I would say. I was impressed with Zenitsu. Throughout most of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, I have found Zenitsu to be one of, if not the most, annoying character in the entire series. While I will admit he has his moments of being a good friend to Tanjiro, a decent comrade in battle, and humorous sometimes, I just can’t stand his whiny and cowardly behavior. However, Volume 17 does a great job of making him more likable because it shows more of his courageous and determined side, which I thought was very refreshing.  Lastly, I enjoyed the afterwords at the end of each chapter in this volume. The afterwords are definitely worth reading and paying attention to because there are some additional information and insight into characters that aren’t mentioned in the chapters. Not to give any spoilers away, but the afterwords have information that connects Zenitsu, Shinobu, Himejima’s pasts.  Overall, I can’t recommend Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Volume 17 enough. The action and intensity kick it up a notch from where things were left off at the end of Volume 16. Koyoharu Gotouge’s awesome talent for capturing fluid motions and intensity in action scenes shines in this volume. However, I warn readers the stakes are extremely high some fan-favorite characters and it might be hard to keep reading, as many characters are in some dangerous battles. Still, I promise it is so worth it to continue reading.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 17: Successors"}, {"title": "!!!!", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review_text": "I'm currently on vol 15 of this series and made myself take a little break after reading 4 volumes in a day!

Miraculously Genya is still alive hoping that his regenerative power can heal even his fatal wound. The Hashira Himejima and Sanemi face-off with Kokushibo and unleash all of their skills against him. Although Himejima is blind, he may have a chance against Kokushibo’s whirlwind of flashing blades, if he can see into the Transparent World.  If I had to pick two words to describe this volume in two words, they would be intense and heart-wrenching. The mangaka, Koyoharu Gotouge, does not hold back on the emotions or high-stakes action in any of the chapters in Volume 20. A majority of this volume focused on the battle between the Himejima, Sanemi, Genya, and Muichiro as they face-off against Muzan’s strongest demon, the former Demon Slayer, Kokushibo. I honestly had to read the whole volume in one sitting because I could not put this manga down and have to know what the outcomes would be in the end.  The artwork is great in this volume, however, I felt like there are some pages that have a lot going on all at once. It does a great job of capturing the chaos of the battle, but it also makes it hard to digest. It is worthwhile to just slow down and take in all of the action and illustrations taking place during some scenes.  Another thing that I loved about Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, Volume 20 was the writing. Gotouge really captures the characters’ emotions in Volume 20 Throughout the volume you can really feel the Himejima, Sanemi, Genya, and Muichiro desperation on every page of this volume. The character’s inner monologues and dialogues with one another are what sell the intensity of the scenes and their desperation to defeat Kokushibo. Even though the Demon Slayers know that the odds are not in their favor.  Their opponent surpasses them in skill, hundreds of years of experience, and not only is a top-ranked demon but a former Demon Slayer as well. It is the way that the Himejima and the other Demon Slayers sacrifice and put their lives on the line, for one another to get an advantage against their enemy that really sells their desperation. Even though they are fully aware that this isn’t a fight that they will survive. They know that this is a fight they can not afford to lose, even if that means they have to die to succeed.  Overall, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, Volume 20 is heart wrenching, intense, and you won’t want to put the manga down until the last page. Koyoharu Gotouge continues to build upon the suspense and tension in every chapter of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, Volume 20.

However, I can't help but feel this ending is a little rushed. For a series that has brought out so much emotion from me it kind of ends on a flat note. The villain's defeat feels kind of lack lustre, a lot of set ups were never really delivered on, and it feels like it very much looses it's momentum from the last volume.  This last arc as a whole just brought in way too much new information with little to no set up and I can't help but feel it kinda leaves you feeling at once overwhelmed and empty when it's done.  That said though, I would still highly recommend finishing, or even rereading the series as a whole. It's a send off to a slightly long winded era that I feel with the conclusion of Demon Slayer the world of manga will really be moving on from.  It's been one heck of a ride, and I'm glad to say that for the ending's shortcomings it's still a worthwhile read.", "book name": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 23: Life Shining Across The Years"}, {"title": null, "rating": null, "review_text": "Es la primera vez que tengo una edición de esta editorial.
